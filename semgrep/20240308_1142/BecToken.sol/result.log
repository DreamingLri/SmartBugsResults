METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

          Uninitialized variables are assigned with the types default value.    
  Explicitly initializing a

       solidity.performance.unnecessary-checked-arithmetic-in-loop              
          A lot of times there is no risk that the loop counter can overflow.   
  Using Solidity's                                                              
          unchecked block saves the overflow checks.

       solidity.performance.use-multiple-require                                
          Using multiple require statements is cheaper than using && multiple   
  check combinations.                                                           
          There are more advantages, such as easier to read code and better     
  coverage reports.

          Consider using the prefix increment expression whenever the return    
  value is not needed. The
